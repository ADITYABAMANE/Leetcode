Problem statement
Nezuko and Zenitsu were playing Rock Paper Scissors which is a very popular game where each player can do three moves which are: ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ and ‘Scissor’.

The winner of a game is decided in the following way:

‘Rock’ beats ‘Scissor’.

‘Scissor’ beats ‘Paper’.

‘Paper’ beats ‘Rock’.

If both players make the same move like ‘Rock’ is made by both person then that result in a draw and whose point will not be rewarded to anyone.

Now you have been provided with two strings representing the moves that they will make for ‘NEZUKO’ represents Nezuko’s string and ‘ZENITSU’ represents Zenitsu’s moves.

In the string ‘R’ represents ‘ROCK’ and ‘P’ represents ‘PAPER’ and ‘S’ represents ‘SCISSORS’.

There is a total of ‘K’ games that will be played and the player will play the move by traversing the string provided. If a player reaches the end of the string then his next moves will be played from the start of the string.

You have to tell the number of games won by Nezuko and the number of games won by Zenitsu respectively in order.

Example:
Input: ‘K’ = 3, ‘NEZUKO’ = ‘RP’, ‘ZENITSU’ = ‘R’
Output: 1 0
Game 1: ‘NEZUKO’ = ‘R’, ‘ZENITSU’ =  ‘R’, Result = ‘Draw’.
Game 2: ‘NEZUKO’ = ‘P’, ‘ZENITSU’ = ‘R’, Result = ‘Nezuko won the game’.
Game 3: ‘NEZUKO’ = ‘R’, ‘ZENITSU’ =  ‘R’, Result = ‘Draw’.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10 
1 <= K <= 10^5
1<= |NEZUKO| <= 10^5
1<= |ZENITSU| <= 10^5

        //starts from the beginning of the string again.
